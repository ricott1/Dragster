Can a machine learning algorithm beat the legendary world record set by Todd Rogers?

From en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragster_(video_game)


The world record on Dragster is claimed to have been set in 1982 by video gamer Todd Rogers with a time of 5.51 seconds, and this claim is accepted by video game racing organization Twin Galaxies. This time is recognized by Guinness World Records as the longest-standing video-game world record. However, the record is mired in controversy, with many players believing that it is false.



This genetic algorithm implements the rules of the game as stated by Omnigamer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v7a29O7OkM) to try to beat 5.57, the supposed best possible time.
